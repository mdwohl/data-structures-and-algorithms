# Challenge Summary
Kamit and I whiteboarded this challenge to write a function for zipping two linked lists together, alternating node by node.

## Challenge Description
Write a function that takes two link lists, starts from the head of List 1, and adds the head of List two immediately after Head 1. Continue alternating every other note until there is one "zipped" linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
We spend a good amount of time coming up with a whiteboard. While the problem domain and visual seemed clear, we struggled to write the pseudocode. My understanding is that the time & space efficiency were both O(n). I did not successfully complete the challenge on the first pass; we found some good starting points, but I'll need to revisit this.
